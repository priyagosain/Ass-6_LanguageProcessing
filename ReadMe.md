#Python programs
ScatterPlot.py : to plot the training dataset clusters with the help of TruncatedSVD for visualization.
DecisionTree.py, LogisticRegression.py, MultinomialNB.py and LinearSVC: for feature extraction, transformation and loading it to the pipeline for creating the respective classifier models. Also, confusion matrices of each classifier is plotted for a better visualization.
TrainingModels.py : To build the classifier models for each classification algorithm and fetching the accuracy score too
